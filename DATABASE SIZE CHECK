/* How to check database size in mysql */

Use this query to check your database size before auditing in mysql.

SELECT table_schema "DB Name",
        ROUND(SUM(data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024, 1) "DB Size in MB" 
FROM information_schema.tables 
GROUP BY table_schema; 

/* How to check database size in SQL SERVER */

FIRST METHOD
Check database size using query in SQL SERVER

 sys.master_files Script 
SELECT
    DBname,
    size,
    size * 8/1024 'Size (MB)',
    max_size
FROM sys.master_files;

To limit the results to a particular database, add the following line before the semicolon:
WHERE DB_NAME(database_id) = 'DatabaseName'

sp_helpdb Stored Procedure
EXEC sp_helpdb;

sp_databases Stored Procedure
EXEC sp_databases;

OR

(SELECT 
      database_name = DB_NAME(database_id)
    , log_size_mb = CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN type_desc = 'LOG' THEN size END) * 8. / 1024 AS DECIMAL(8,2))
    , row_size_mb = CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN type_desc = 'ROWS' THEN size END) * 8. / 1024 AS DECIMAL(8,2))
    , total_size_mb = CAST(SUM(size) * 8. / 1024 AS DECIMAL(8,2))
FROM sys.master_files WITH(NOWAIT)
WHERE database_id = DB_ID() -- for current db 
GROUP BY database_id )

/*Second Method for checking database size*/

If you need to check a single database, you can quickly find the SQL Server database sizein SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): Right-click the database and then click Reports -> Standard Reports -> Disk Usage. Alternatively, you can use stored procedures like exec sp_spaceused to get database size. However, both of these methods will show you the size of only a single database. To process all databases on SQL Server, you have to use T-SQL queries, which are complex and require more extensive scripting skills.
